# Garden of Memories
An adventure and puzzle game about rebuilding an old garden and recovering lost memories.


## Code Management and Branches
- Do a branch of Develop if you intend to work on a new feature;
- Since we are working with Unity, do a test scene separately for yourself to work/test;
- Preferably have an issue for the feature you will be working on;
- After completion, please delete the branch you worked on and the related issue if it exists;
- Merges to master will be done once we have a certain number of features implemented and relatively tested.

## Todo - Write TODOs here either code related or off-code related if you so wish
- Briefing for new team members;
- Do a proper design document and create issues;
- Discuss itch.io page.
